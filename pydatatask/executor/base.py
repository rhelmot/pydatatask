"""This module houses the executors.

An executor is an interface that allows executing various classes of runnables. The generic executor interface doesn't
actually allow this, but instead allows you to attempt to upcast your executor into a type which provides a specific
runnable type (containers, processes, or kubernetes pods), which may fail.

This level of abstraction allows Tasks to be unconcerned by which executor they are passed, which allows Task to be a
class focused on what is run instead of how it is run.
